# Global Currency Debasement Tracker

## Welcome to the Monetary Apocalypse

Ever wondered how fast your money is turning into toilet paper? Look no further! This interactive visualization brings you front-row seats to the greatest magic show on Earth: the vanishing act of your purchasing power.

## What's This All About?

This project offers a grim, color-coded tour of the world's currencies as they race to the bottom against the almighty US Dollar (which, let's face it, is just the prettiest horse in the glue factory).

## Features

- Watch in real-time as central banks worldwide compete in the "Who can print money faster?" Olympics
- Color-coded map: from "slightly on fire" (red) to "this is fine" (green)
- Hover over countries to see just how badly their currency is doing (spoiler: it's usually bad)
- Data pulled straight from the horse's mouth: Yahoo Finance (because who else would you trust with financial data?)
- Responsive design, because you should be able to watch this tragedy unfold on any device

## Why Should I Care?

- Planning a vacation? Find out where your money is least worthless!
- Considering forex trading? Here's a handy guide on what to avoid (hint: almost everything)
- Want to feel better about your own financial decisions? There's always a central bank doing worse!

## Technologies Used

- Vue.js 3 (because we need something stable in this unstable world)
- D3.js for map visualization (making bad news look pretty since 2011)
- Vite as the build tool (it's fast, unlike economic recovery)
- Yahoo Finance API for currency data (real-time depression, delivered to your browser)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A computer (your phone will probably be worthless by the time you finish setting this up)
- Node.js (because JavaScript is the only thing inflating faster than fiat currencies)
- A dark sense of humor and a stiff drink (not included)

### Installation

1. Clone the repo:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/snoboll/currencydebasement2.git
   cd currencydebasement2
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the server and watch the world burn:

   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` (or whatever port your terminal suggests â€“ it's not like constants exist in this economy anyway)

## How to Use

- Hover over countries to see detailed information about their currency's performance against the USD
- Color guide:
  - Green: This currency is winning the "least worthless" contest
  - Red: Hope you like ramen
  - Black: Either no data or this country has gone full barter system
